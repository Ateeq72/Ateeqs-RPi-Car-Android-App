Thanks to jrbenito for UDP stuff @ https://github.com/jrbenito/Android-UDP-Terminal
Thanks to zerokol for "JoyStickView"

This is just a basic application to transfer data to UDP server hosted on any provided IP. 

In this case this app sends preconfigured data to control RPi Car Motions which has a UDP Server hosted.

Anybody can modify/use the code but please make sure you provide proper credits! Thanks:)
